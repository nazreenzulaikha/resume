<h2 id="photograph"> Photograph </h2>
<p align="justify">  The idea of colours floating across a sheet of paper forming either familiar shapes or new creations is appealing to the eye. In reality, though it is much more than just the beads of colour. Photography can capture someone’s heart and soul. Even the simplest photo has a story that tails along with it. It is an escape from the real world; a creation that narrows on one particular subject and carefully details their every move and emotion.
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="education"> Education </h2>

<p align="justify">
Education is a significant tool that provides knowledge, skill, technique, information and enables people to know their rights and duties towards their family, society and the nation. You can expand your vision and outlook to see the world around us. It changes our perception of life. Education builds up the ability to explore new things to enhance your creativity. Your creativity is a tool to develop the nation.
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="multimedia"> Multimedia </h2>

<p align="justify">
Multimedia project provides a more creative path through development and production. The process includes phases like planning, design, development, prototyping, testing, and delivery. An insight of social development and future of multimedia is given. It provides information on multimedia such as disabilities, techniques, uses and structure.
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="interview"> Interview </h2>

<p align="justify">
People conduct matters also while in the interviewing process. Your speech is an important factor. Always be polite to your interviewer. For example you should address them by their last name unless they tell you other wise. Never use slang in front of your interviewer. It does not look right and it shows them you cannot hold a professional conversation. For example, never use word "ya" always say yes. Another big factor is your arrival to the interview. Always be on time, try to be there fifteen minutes early. Never be late to job interview. In their minds they're thinking if you cannot make it to an interview on time how could you make your shift on time.
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="motivation"> Motivation </h2>

<p align="justify">
Motivation is important in life because it helps us gain valued results like personal growth, better well-being, enhanced performance, or a sense of confidence. Motivation is a road to improve our way of feeling, thinking, and behaving. The advantages of motivation are seen in our way of living life.
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="soft"> Soft Skills </h2>
<p align="justify">
 soft skills refer to both character traits and interpersonal skills that will influence how well a person can work or interact with others. If that sounds a rather large and vague area, that’s because it is, and the term soft skills covers a wide spectrum of skills as diverse as creativity, time management, problem solving and emotional intelligence. In fact, the World Economic Forum Future of Jobs report last year suggested that by 2020, complex problem-solving, critical thinking, creativity, people management and emotional intelligence would be among the most important skills required in the workplace.
